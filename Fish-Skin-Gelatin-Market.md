This trend will further push the market growth for fish-based gelatin products.</li> <li><strong>Cosmetic and Pharmaceutical Growth:</strong> The cosmetic industry, particularly skincare products, is expected to be a major driver for gelatin demand, as collagen's anti-aging properties become more recognized. Fish skin gelatin, with its high collagen content, is anticipated to become a staple in many skincare and wellness products.</li> <li><strong>Regional Growth Patterns:</strong> Asia-Pacific is expected to continue dominating the market due to high fish consumption rates and the rising demand for collagen-based products. North America and Europe will also see steady growth as health-conscious consumers seek out cleaner, more sustainable ingredients.</li></ul><p>The transition from 2018-2022 to 2023-2033 marks a phase where fish skin gelatin is expected to shift from a niche ingredient to a mainstream product in various industries.
